# Sampleapp

Example app for parsing kinesis stream with elixir and flow, for some real time services.


### How this demo works

* We are using docker and docker-compose
* We use [localstack](https://localstack.cloud/) for emulate kinesis in localhost
* [ex_aws_kinesis](https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws_kinesis) library to iteract with local kinesis
